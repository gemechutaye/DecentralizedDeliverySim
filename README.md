A Python-based simulation for CMSI 6998 (Spring 2025) exploring online algorithms and decentralized systems. This project models autonomous delivery agents finding moving customers in a grid, coordinating without a central server, and handling a Byzantine agent spreading false data.

## üöÄ Features

- **Online Search Algorithms**: Agents use a spiral search pattern to efficiently locate moving customers when their positions are unknown.
- **Decentralized Consensus**: Agents share information and vote on customer locations locally without central coordination.
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: The system can handle malicious agents that intentionally spread false information about customer positions.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time Pygame visualization with color-coded elements:
  - Blue circles: Normal agents
  - Red circles: Byzantine (malicious) agents
  - Green squares: Customers awaiting delivery
  - Yellow paths: Agent movement history
- **Performance Metrics**: Real-time calculation of competitive ratio and other efficiency metrics.
- **Dashboard Display**: Interactive dashboard showing simulation statistics and agent performance.

## üß© Project Structure

- **`main.py`**: Entry point that initializes the environment, agents, and runs the simulation loop.
- **`environment.py`**: Manages the grid world, customer positions, and environment dynamics.
- **`agent.py`**: Defines agent behavior including movement patterns, knowledge representation, and decision-making.
- **`consensus.py`**: Implements the decentralized consensus algorithm for knowledge sharing among agents.
- **`visualize.py`**: Handles all visualization aspects including the grid, agents, customers, and dashboard.
- **`metrics.py`**: Calculates performance metrics such as competitive ratio to evaluate agent efficiency.

## üìä Simulation Parameters

- **Grid Size**: 20x20 cells
- **Agents**: 5 total (4 normal, 1 Byzantine)
- **Customers**: 3 randomly placed on the grid
- **Maximum Steps**: 100 (simulation ends after this many steps)
- **Byzantine Agent**: Agent 0 is designated as Byzantine and may spread false information

## üîç Implementation Details

### Agent Behavior
Agents use a combination of strategies:
1. **Target-seeking**: When a customer location is known, agents move directly toward it.
2. **Spiral Search**: When no customer locations are known, agents perform an outward spiral search pattern.
3. **Knowledge Sharing**: When agents are within communication range, they share customer location information.

### Consensus Algorithm
The consensus mechanism filters potentially false information:
1. Agents share observed customer locations with nearby agents.
2. Each agent maintains a belief system about customer locations.
3. Majority voting is used to filter out false information from Byzantine agents.

### Visualization
The visualization system provides:
1. Real-time rendering of the grid, agents, and customers.
2. Path visualization showing agent movement history.
3. Dashboard with performance metrics and simulation statistics.
4. Color-coding to distinguish between normal and Byzantine agents.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recent Updates

- Fixed color format issues in visualization for proper rendering with alpha values
- Updated competitive ratio calculation to handle edge cases
- Added missing math module import in main.py
- Improved dashboard visualization with proper text colors
- Added requirements.txt for easier dependency management

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- Scale to larger numbers of agents and customers
- Implement more sophisticated Byzantine behaviors
- Add delivery completion animations and scoring
- Optimize consensus algorithms for larger grids
- Implement different agent strategies for comparison
